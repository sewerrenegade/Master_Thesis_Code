    Parameters
    ----------
    iterable : iterable
    Returns
    -------
    iterator
        An iterator to iterate over consecutive pairs of the input data.
    Notes
    -----
    A similar function appears in more recent versions of the
    ``collections`` module. For compatibility with old Python
    versions, we provide our own implementation.

    This function provides a convenience wrapper for variables that need
    to be iterated over. If the variable is already an `iterable`, there
    is nothing to be done and it will be returned as-is. Otherwise, will
    'wrap' the variable to be the single item of a list.
    The primary purpose of this function is to make it easier for users
    to interact with certain classes: essentially, one does not have to
    think any more about single inputs vs. `iterable` inputs.
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : any
        Input object.
    Returns
    -------
    list or type of x
        If `x` can be iterated over, `x` will be returned as-is. Else,
        will return `[x]`, i.e. a list containing `x`.
    Examples
    --------
    >>> wrap_if_not_iterable(1.0)
    [1.0]
    >>> wrap_if_not_iterable('Hello, World!')

    To convert between sparse and dense representations of topological
    features, we need to determine the nesting level of an input list.
    The nesting level is defined as the maximum number of times we can
    recurse into the object while still obtaining lists.
    Parameters
    ----------
    x : list
        Input list of objects.
    Returns
    -------
    int
        Nesting level of `x`. If `x` has no well-defined nesting level,
        for example because `x` is not a list of something, will return

    Notes
    -----
    This function is implemented recursively. It is therefore a bad idea
    to apply it to objects with an extremely high nesting level.

    --------
    >>> nesting_level([1, 2, 3])
    1
    >>> nesting_level([[1, 2], [3, 4]])

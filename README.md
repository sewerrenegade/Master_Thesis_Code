# Improving Topologically-Regularized Multiple Instance Learning on Single Cell Images

This is the repository for Milad Bassil's Master's thesis conducted at [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de), under the supervision of **Salome Kazeminia** and the advisorship of **Carsten Marr** and **Bastian Rieck** as part of [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/). 

The thesis, titled *Improving Topologically-Regularized Multiple Instance Learning on Single Cell Images*, details the work done in this project, which can be found here: [Insert link later].

## Abstract
*Include the abstract of your thesis here if you'd like.*

## Repository Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and supplementary materials used in the project. It includes:
